          <h2>The Objective is Simple:</h2>
          <p class="characterText gameText">Battle back the incoming waves of Kitchen Utensils with the help of some Produce. For every utensil you push back, earn more
            credits to get even more produce.
          </p>
          <h2>Single Player</h2>
          <img class="gPics" src="Assets/Images/g1.png" />
          <p class="gameText">
            Survive against waves of kitchen utensils for as long as you can. The kitchen utensils will get tougher and faster as the game goes on, but so will your
            defense as you stop utensils and earn more credits to bolster your battalion of produce.
          </p>
          <h2>Multiplayer</h2>
          <img class="gPics" src="Assets/Images/g2.png" />
          <p class="gameText">
            Play side-by-side against an opponent in a multiplayer mode. Try to last longer than your opponent as waves of kitchen utensils repeatedly attempt to reach the goal.
            There is a twist, as players can choose to spend their credits not only boosting their defenses, but also spending money to send utensils to the opposing player. Test
            your strategy as you try to balance attack and defense in multiplayer!

                An apple a day keeps the doctor away, as well as any kitchen utensils in the area. The Apple deals Area of Effect damage to kitchen utensils nearby, being able to stop more than one utensil at a time. Although a little more costly, the Apple makes a great addition to any defense

                The Spatula is always frowning, and is very sad about walking into a field of produce that does not like him. The spatula is a basic enemy, who moves around very slowly.

                Like the Spatula, the Pan is also sad about opposing the vegetables that were once friendly. Unlike the Spatula, the Pan is a real threat to your defense, being faster and much more durable. Vegetables beware.
